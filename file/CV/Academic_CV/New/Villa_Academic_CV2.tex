\begin{rSection}{Research interests and Publications}
I am interested in mathematical modelling of cell populations to study problems in development (vasculogenesis) and cancer (intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity). I have been focussing on continuous, deterministic models of time- and space-dependent population dynamics. These models comprise systems of nonlinear, nonlocal partial differential equations, pose interesting analytical and numerical challenges, and  complement experimental research by providing a theoretical framework for \textit{in silico} investigations. \\
%I am interested in mathematical modelling of cell populations to study problems in development (vasculogenesis) and cancer (intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity). I have been focussing on continuous, deterministic models of time- and space-dependent population dynamics, possibly with additional phenotypic structure. These models comprise systems of non-linear, non-local partial differential equations, which pose interesting analytical and numerical challenges, and may complement experimental research by providing a theoretical framework for \textit{in silico} investigations.
